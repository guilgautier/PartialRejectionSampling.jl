Some implementations of partial rejection samplers for

- Rooted spanning forests
- Sink free graphs
- Hard core model on graph (independent sets)
- Strauss and Hard Core point processes
- Ising model

based on the works of

For now, examples are located in the `test` folder.

Building a proper documentation is work in progress.

Any feedback is welcome :)
