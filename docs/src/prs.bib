abstract = {Recently, Guo, Jerrum, and Liu introduced a simple and powerful general purpose algorithm for exact uniform sampling, which they called partial rejection sampling (PRS). The technique has applications to a variety of sampling problems, including random spanning trees, sink-free orientations of a graph, satisfying assignments of certain CNFs, and point configurations from the so-called Hard Disks model. It was also used to give an FPRAS for the all-terminal network reliability problem. PRS always produces uniform samples by design, but in general, it can be quite inefficient in many cases, it simply degenerates to rejection sampling. In this paper, we prove that PRS can be used to efficiently sample from two types of spaces. The first space is the set of strings s avoiding some contiguous substring w. The second is the set of (non-induced) subgraphs of various grids avoiding acertain subgraph H. In each case, we exploit the geometry of the underlying dependency graphs to prove the efficiency of PRS in parameter regimes that are much larger than those obtained by simply applying the original analysis of Guo et al. to these problems.},

abstract = {This paper presents and studies a generalization of the microscopic image reconstruction problem (MIR) introduced by Frosini and Nivat [7, 12]. Consider a specimen for inspection, represented as a collection of points typically organized on a grid in the plane. Assume each point x has an associated physical value `x, which we would like to determine. However, it might be that obtaining these values precisely (by a surgical probe) is difficult, risky, or impossible. The alternative is to employ aggregate measuring techniques (such as EM, CT, US or MRI), whereby each measurement is taken over a larger window, and the exact values at each point are subsequently extracted by computational methods. In this paper we extend the MIR framework in a number of ways. First, we consider a generalized setting where the inspected object is represented by an arbitrary graph G, and the vector ` ∈ Rn assigns a value `v to each node v. A probe centered at a vertex v will capture a window encompassing its entire neighborhood N[v], i.e., the outcome of a probe centered at v is Pv = Pw∈N[v] `w. We give a criterion for the graphs for which the extended MIR problem can be solved by extracting the vector ` from the collection of probes, P¯ = {Pv | v ∈ V }. We then consider cases where such reconstruction is impossible (namely, graphs G for which the probe vector P is inconclusive, in the sense that there may be more than one vector ` yielding P). Let us assume that surgical probes (whose outcome at vertex v is the exact value of `v) are technically available to us (yet are expensive or risky, and must be used sparingly). We show that in such cases, it may still be possible to achieve reconstruction based on a combination of a collection of standard probes together with a suitable set of surgical probes. We aim at identifying the minimum number of surgical probes necessary for a unique reconstruction, depending on the graph topology. This is referred to as the Minimum Surgical Probing problem (MSP). Besides providing a solution for the above problems for arbitrary graphs, we also explore the range of possible behaviors of the Minimum Surgical Probing problem by determining the number of surgical probes necessary in certain specific graph families, such as perfect k-ary trees, paths, cycles, grids, tori and tubes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of sampling from a graphical model when the model itself is changing dynamically with time. This problem derives its interest from a variety of inference, learning, and sampling settings in machine learning, computer vision, statistical physics, and theoretical computer science. While the problem of sampling from a static graphical model has received considerable attention, theoretical works for its dynamic variants have been largely lacking. The main contribution of this paper is an algorithm that can sample dynamically from a broad class of graphical models over discrete random variables. Our algorithm is parallel and Las Vegas: it knows when to stop and it outputs samples from the exact distribution. We also provide sufficient conditions under which this algorithm runs in time proportional to the size of the update, on general graphical models as well as well-studied specific spin systems. In particular we obtain, for the Ising model (ferromagnetic or anti-ferromagnetic) and for the hardcore model the first dynamic sampling algorithms that can handle both edge and vertex updates (addition, deletion, change of functions), both efficient within regimes that are close to the respective uniqueness regimes, beyond which, even for the static and approximate sampling, no local algorithms were known or the problem itself is intractable. Our dynamic sampling algorithm relies on a local resampling algorithm and a new “equilibrium” property that is shown to be satisfied by our algorithm at each step, and enables us to prove its correctness. This equilibrium property is robust enough to guarantee the correctness of our algorithm, helps us improve bounds on fast convergence on specific models, and should be of independent interest.},

abstract = {Traditionally, coupling from the past (CFTP) methods are used to generate perfect samples from finite Gibbs hard-sphere models, an important class of spatial point processes, which is a set of spheres with the centers on a bounded region that are distributed as a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) conditioned that spheres do not overlap with each other. We propose an alternative importance sampling based rejection methodology for the perfect sampling of these models. We analyze the asymptotic expected running time complexity of the proposed method when the intensity of the reference PPP increases to infinity while the (expected) sphere radius decreases to zero at varying rates. We further compare the performance of the proposed method analytically and numerically with a naive rejection algorithm and popular dominated CFTP algorithms. Our analysis relies upon identifying large deviations decay rates of the non-overlapping probability of spheres whose centers are distributed as a homogeneous PPP.},
